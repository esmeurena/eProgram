#### Introduction

Hera Labs is a female-focused business accelerator where our mindfully-crafted curriculum helps women launch their dreams.

When you walk into Hera Labs, we meet you exactly where you are with your business. Bring us your kernel of an idea and we will help you test and develop a solid business model and strategy. Rather than having to push your idea and business uphill, unassisted, your concept grows immediate “legs” and gets a beautifully strong reality check before it hits the market, with development and structured feedback built in at each step of the way.
